    "## The Model-View-Controller Pattern\n",
    "The Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle: The idea behind the SoC principle is to split an application into distinct sections, where each section addresses a separate concern. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is nothing more than the SoC principle applied to OOP. The name of the pattern comes from the three main components used to split a software application: the model, the view, and the controller.\n",
    "* Model: contains and manages the (business) logic, data, state, and rules of an application.\n",
    "* View: a visual representation of the model. Examples of views are a computer GUI, the text output of a computer terminal, a smartphone's application GUI, a PDF document, a pie chart ...\n",
    "* Controller: All communication between the model and the view happens through a controller."
